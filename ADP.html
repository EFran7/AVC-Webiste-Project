        <h3 class='secheader' id="adpHeader2">Why is this initiative important?</h3>
      </div>
      <div id="adpContainer2">
        <ul id="whatWeOfferADP">
          <li>Autistic people, more often than not, face a whole host of difficulties
          when deciding to seek an official diagnosis; these difficulties only increase
          for AFAB and older individuals. Often getting a professional who is <h4>familiar
          with more than one view of autism</h4> is difficult; older
          individuals have often masked heavily their whole life, so many write them off
          neurotypical.</li>
          <li>However, even after doing research and talking to the right people, many
          still are unable to get a diagnosis due to steep costs; the whole process
          can cost <h4>up to $5000.</h4></li>
          <li>Getting an official autism diagnosis allows autistic children, teens, and adult
          alike to access <h4>resources and accomodations at school and work</h4> that they couldn't
          have gotten otherwise. Furthermore, for many the diagnosis is validating on a personal
          level. Many late-diagnosed people have felt out of place and confused with themselves
          for years; diagnosis actually <h4>helps self-image and mental health</h4> in this way.</li>
