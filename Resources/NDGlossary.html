            figure who was a nazi researcher. Autistic people generally do not

            the term provides.</td>

            year usually. Engaging in our special interests helps us recharge
            and brings immense joy, without doing so for awhile can cause

            as possible, so ask us!

            In terms of autism, the idea of functioning labels comes from the outdated
            linear spectrum model. The implication that one person can be "high or low
            functioning" is very harmful to both sides. If someone is called low functioning
            people will often assume they cannot think for themselves and treat their opinions 
            with less respect. If someone is labeled high functioning they often won't be able
            to get as much support or even access to proper diagnosis since they "seem like they
            are fine," when in reality it's just masking. <br><br>Contrary to popular belief, we
            don't need these labels to help section off who needs which accomodations. Instead of
            labeling us, just ask what we need.
