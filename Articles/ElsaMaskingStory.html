      <h2>What masking as an autistic person feels like: Elsa Frankel's
      story with masking in highschool and middle school</h2>
      <h4 id='Articleh4'>June 27, 2021, 7:00pm EST</h4>
      <h3>Written by: Elsa Frankel</h3>
      <p id='Articlep'>Masking is something many autistic people do in attempts to fit in
      with the Neurotypical social structure. While it might look like we
      are feeling no different than usual from the outside, masking is very
      tiring to autistic people, and can cause us mental distress if we are
      unable to unmask at some point.
      <br>
      <br>
      before I was recieved my official autism Diagnosis in 8th grade, I was
      masking constantly; I didn't know it at the time of course, but that's
      what I was doing. During my early middle school years I was pretty much
      what you would call a loner, or as I liked to call myself, "an extreme"
      introvert. Socializing stressed me out beyond belief, but even more than
      that, it exhasted me. I found myself constantly craving time away from
      people; when I got that time, it felt almost freeing. On top of that,
      I was always very hard on myself for not being "as good at socializing"
      as my peers were. In the harder moments I would tell myself to just stop
      talking to people because I "couldn't do it well enough." My masking was
      fairly intense, and well, clearly wasn't always working as well as I would
      have liked.
